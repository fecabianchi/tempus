# Tempus

## What is it?

**Tempus** is a minimalist, blazing-fast, and scalable scheduler designed to handle time-based job execution with maximum efficiency and simplicity.

## Goals

Tempus should:

- Execute scheduled jobs reliably  
- Support HTTP and Kafka messaging out of the box  
- Be extensible to support other communication protocols (e.g., via plugin system or trait-based abstractions)  
- Expose a minimal yet expressive API  
- Be easy to integrate into any system  
- Deliver high performance with low resource usage  
- Scale horizontally and vertically with minimal effort
